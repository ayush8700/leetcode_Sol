# 3362. Zero Array Transformation III
#
# You are given:
# - An integer array `nums` of length `n`
# - A list of `queries[i] = [li, ri]` indicating that:
#     - You can decrement **each index** in range `[li, ri]` by **at most 1**
#     - The decrement amount can be chosen independently per index per query
#
# Goal:
# - Return the **maximum number of queries you can remove**
#   such that `nums` can still be converted to a Zero Array.
# - If itâ€™s impossible to make all elements 0 even with all queries, return -1.
#
# Constraints:
# - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# - 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
# - 1 <= queries.length <= 10^5
# - 0 <= li <= ri < nums.length
